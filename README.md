# Sport activities: Time series
The repo contains code for an assignment completed by me for [Asigmo Data Science](www.asigmo.com) programme and is analysing records of sport activities. 

For chosen activities a time series is constructed, and predictions are made for the next 12 months.

## List of files and folders:

1. **Finding numbers**: a script (1_finding_numbers.py) and data to run the script on (1_finding_numbers.txt, [source](http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/)). The script reads through and parses a file with text and numbers, extracts all the numbers in the file, and computes their sum.
