# Sport activities: Time series
The repo contains code for an assignment completed by me for [Asigmo Data Science](www.asigmo.com) programme and is analysing records of sport activities. 

For chosen activities a time series is constructed, and predictions are made for the next 12 months.

## List of files and folders:

1. **Time series: Sport activities**: a script (sport_activities_time_series.Rmd) reads through and parses a json file, and analyses records of sport activities. It selects a number of metrics of the activities, and creates and analyses monthly time series out of it. It also attempts to predict each time series 12 months ahead.
